# Environment Configuration Update

This document summarizes the changes made to improve the environment configuration and integration between the Flask app and Rust backend.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated the `.env` file** with important configurations from `.env.example`:
   - Added API configuration for documentation
   - Added file upload configuration
   - Added CSRF security settings
   - Added Rust logging configuration

2. **Enhanced Rust backend to use environment variables**:
   - Added `env_logger` and `log` dependencies to Cargo.toml
   - Updated main.rs to initialize logging from the RUST_LOG environment variable
   - Added proper logging statements in the Rust code

3. **Improved Python scripts to better manage environment**:
   - Modified run.py to pass environment variables to the Rust backend
   - Added a check-env command to verify environment variable setup
   - Added a run-all command to start both Flask and Rust backend together

4. **Added python-dotenv to requirements**:
   - Added python-dotenv for better environment variable management

## New Commands

The following new commands are now available:

```
# Check if all required environment variables are set
flask check-env

# Run both Flask app and Rust backend in parallel
flask run-all
```

## Using Environment Configuration

### Development

For development, the existing `.env` file now includes all necessary configuration. You can simply run:

```
flask run-all
```

This will start both the Flask app and the Rust backend with the proper environment variables.

### Production

For production, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update all values appropriately. Make sure to set:

- `FLASK_ENV=production`
- `FLASK_DEBUG=False`
- Generate strong, random values for `SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
- Configure database with PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
- Set up proper email configuration
- Configure Redis for background tasks
- Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True`

## Debugging

If you encounter issues with the Rust backend, you can adjust the log level by changing:

```
RUST_LOG=info
```

to one of:
- `RUST_LOG=debug` - More detailed information for debugging
- `RUST_LOG=trace` - Extremely verbose information for deep debugging
